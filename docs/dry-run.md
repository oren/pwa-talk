## Name of the presentation

Are Progressive Web Apps the future of web development?

## Summary

Progressive Web Apps or PWAs is a new way to build performance-driven websites.
It even compete with native - it gives you an app-like experience, offline support, and push notifications. A few weeks ago Twitter announced twitter light. which is a PWA. Many users (including myself) uninstalled the app and are using the PWA instead because it's better. There are other examples such as Aliexpress which is Alibaba's retail website, and Uber.
