title: the same.

Oren has been hacking on both web and back-end related technologies for years. When he was 12 he wrote his first program - an ASCII robot named Itzik that was doing jumping jacks. Lately he has being playing with graph databases, Go, and Progressive Web Apps. He loves speaking at various conferences and contributes to open source projects and communities. At some point in his life Oren has been a unicyclist, a D&D master, and a dog trainer. This month he celebrates his first birthday at Amazon and accepts anonymous gifts for the occasion.

This session is 5 minute ignite style (20 slides, which automatically advance every 15 seconds) and the rest is live coding.
First I'll talk about building web applications that look and feel like native (Progressive Web Apps) and at the rest of the session we will build a web app together.

Yummy home-made protein bars will be served.


When not practicing handstands or collecting Hello Kitty accessories, Oren likes to create things and break them apart.
